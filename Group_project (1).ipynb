    "# COMP2006: Group Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "To successfully complete this project, you need to collect and process data, then train and evaluate at least two machine learning models and lastly deploy them to a website. Please see below for further details:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python (or a python package) is to be used everywhere it possibly can!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Collection**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data can be collected (legally) from anywhere. You may use data that you already have; or from sites that allow you to download the data, for example, [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/) or [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets); or via web scraping; or via an API. We can restrict ourselves to data that would fit nicely into a spreadsheet. The content and amount of data are not the main consideration, as long as the data has:\n",
    "- at least 10 variables\n",
    "- three or more data types\n",
    "- two or more problems: missing data, inconsistencies, errors, categorical data that needs to be converted to numeric, entries like text that need to be converted into proper features, etc. \n",
    "- if the data does not have enough problems, you can substitute one problem for feature engineering (creating new features from the original features)\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not concerned with acquiring *huge* datasets or creating super accurate models, but more with the process of creating a proper pipeline for machine learning and, for any model deployed, having a reliable estimate of its performance. Although, some effort should go into improving an initial model. \n",
    "\n",
    "How many datasets do you need?\n",
    " - Groups of 2 need **two** datasets\n",
    " - Group of 3 needs **three** datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database**\n",
    "\n",
    "After the data has been collected and processed, it should be stored in a SQLite database. At a minimum, each dataset should have its own table. Database and table creation and data insertion can be done either with the `sqlite3` package or with `Pandas`. Both SQLite and `sqlite3` come with Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each dataset you should train, evaluate, and save a machine learning model:\n",
    "- one model should be for a *classification* problem\n",
    "- the other model should be for a *regression* problem\n",
    "- Group of 3: you should have 2 of one type\n",
    "\n",
    "A *validation* dataset must be used to either select between models, or to choose between hyperparameter values of a single model. \n",
    "\n",
    "A *test* dataset must be used to evaluate the performance of the final chosen model. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Website**\n",
    "\n",
    "The final models should be presented to an end-user through a website. (Deployment need only be to *localhost*). The website must be done using a Python \"web framework\", e.g., *flask*, *Django*, *streamlit*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The website should have:\n",
    " - a *Welcome* page that describes your project\n",
    " - an *About* page for each dataset that provides:\n",
    "     - the source of the dataset\n",
    "     - definition of each variable in the dataset\n",
    "     - a view of a sample of the dataset used for training (pulled from the database)\n",
    " - a page for each machine learning model that:\n",
    "    - identifies the model being used, with a brief description\n",
    "    - allows the end-user to enter their own data to get a prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Readme.md**\n",
    "\n",
    "This file should present the reader with a basic description of your project and how they can use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements.txt**\n",
    "\n",
    "This file contains all packages necessary to run your code. This file should allow the user to install all necessary packages via the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- All project related code in a single Github repository\n",
    "- All code in the repository is only FINAL code\n",
    "- The repository structure is\n",
    "    - main folder\n",
    "        - data collection \n",
    "        - data processing \n",
    "        - database\n",

    "- Each subfolder should be logically organized\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Submission consists of uploading a link to the Github repository containing all the code for your project. There should be one submission per group. \n",
